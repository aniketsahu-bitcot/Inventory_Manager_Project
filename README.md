# Inventory Data Processor

A professional command-line Python package for inventory management.

## Features

- Learned to use OOP to manage complexity by combining data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into classes.

- Refactored the procedural inventory script into Product and Inventory classes following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

- Applied inheritance and the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) to create specialized product types like FoodProduct.

- Structured the project as a Python package with proper modules, type hints, docstrings, and code quality tools (ruff, black).
